A predictive Churn Model is a classification tool which takes in the user activity from the past as data and check to see who is active after a certain time and then create a model that probabilistically identifies the steps and stages when a customer (or segment) is leaving your service or product.  Having a predictive churn model gives you awareness and quantifiable metrics to fight against in your retention efforts. This gives you the ability to pattern habits of customers who leave, and step in before they make that decision. Without this tool, you would be acting on broad assumptions. However with the Churn prediction model, it is a data-driven model that reflects how the customers really act.
